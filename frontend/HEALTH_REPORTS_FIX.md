# Health Reports Visibility Fix

## Problem Identified
Health reports were being shown to users in self-guided mode, which is incorrect because:
- Self-guided mode is not verified by a therapist
- Health reports should only be available when there's therapist supervision
- This could mislead users about the validity of their progress data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Health Reports Section Visibility
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`
- **Before**: `{user.mode === 'Therapist-guided' && ...}`
- **After**: `{user.mode === 'Therapist-guided' && therapyMethod === 'therapist-supervised' && ...}`

Now health reports only show when:
- User is in Therapist-guided mode AND
- Therapy method is set to 'therapist-supervised'

### 2. Updated Health Reports Button in Toggle
**File**: `frontend/src/components/therapy/TherapyMethodToggle.jsx`
- Added conditional rendering for "View Health Reports" button
- Button only appears in therapist-supervised mode
- Added clear messaging about health report availability

### 3. Updated Header Badge
**File**: `frontend/src/components/ui/Header.jsx`
- Added `therapyMethod` prop to Header component
- "Health Reports Available" badge only shows in therapist-supervised mode
- Updated Home.jsx to pass therapyMethod prop to Header

### 4. Enhanced User Communication
**File**: `frontend/src/components/therapy/TherapyMethodToggle.jsx`

**Self-Guided Mode Description:**
- Added warning: "Note: Health reports not available in this mode."
- Uses amber color to indicate limitation

**Therapist-Supervised Mode Description:**
- Added benefit: "Health reports and verified progress tracking included."
- Uses green color to indicate advantage

## Current Behavior

### Self-Guided Mode
✅ No health reports section visible
✅ No "View Health Reports" button
✅ No "Health Reports Available" badge in header
✅ Clear warning message about health reports not being available

### Therapist-Supervised Mode
✅ Health reports section visible
✅ "View Health Reports" button available
✅ "Health Reports Available" badge in header
✅ Clear message about verified progress tracking

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Expectations**: Users now understand what features are available in each mode
2. **No Confusion**: Self-guided users won't see unverified health data
3. **Value Proposition**: Therapist-supervised mode clearly shows its additional benefits
4. **Professional Accuracy**: Only verified, therapist-monitored data is presented as health reports

## Technical Implementation

### Conditional Rendering Logic
```javascript
// Health Reports Section
{user.mode === 'Therapist-guided' && therapyMethod === 'therapist-supervised' && (
  <HealthReportsCard healthReports={healthReports} />
)}

// Health Reports Button
{therapyMethod === 'therapist-supervised' && (
  <button onClick={onViewHealthReports}>View Health Reports</button>
)}

// Header Badge
{user.mode === 'Therapist-guided' && therapyMethod === 'therapist-supervised' && (
  <span>Health Reports Available</span>
)}
```

## Testing Results
✅ Self-guided mode: Health reports properly hidden
✅ Therapist-supervised mode: Health reports properly shown
✅ Toggle between modes: UI updates correctly
✅ No console errors
✅ Hot module replacement working
✅ User messaging is clear and professional

This fix ensures that health reports are only shown when there's actual therapist verification and supervision, maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the health reporting system.
